Hello World!
Name is Uche Ozoemena, a recent (at the time of this writing) believer in the wonderful power of software. I am barely beginning my software engineering journey, and my goal is to become a decent programmer. My dream is to someday build something that isn't just a fun project or functional script on my computer, but something that actually adds value to the lives of others. Watch this space! :-D
